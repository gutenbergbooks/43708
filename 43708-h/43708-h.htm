<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/fig003.png" width="349" height="282" alt="E" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ENTERING as we now are upon the publication of
a third volume of the "Current Notes," the
Second Volume of which we have herewith the
pleasure of presenting in a complete form to
the Public, our first duty as it is our pleasure
is to thank our Subscribers most cordially for
the very liberal support we have received from
them during its progress. It is so seldom
that the productions of the Customer and the
Tradesman form part of the same Periodical, that it is no wonder if the Publisher
of the "Current Notes" feels a little elated by seeing his humble efforts for the
entertainment of the Public in such good company. But this patronage, so far from
dulling his exertions in his legitimate pursuit&mdash;that of promoting the diffusion of Books
in their widest extent&mdash;will only stimulate him to fresh efforts, and while he continues
to place before his Customers the best Books, he trusts that they will be as liberal as
hitherto in their contributions of <i>Current Notes</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Price Current of Literature</i>, indeed, now occupies a position distinct from that
of any other Bookseller's Catalogue ever presented to the public, for it not only furnishes
a monthly list of the principal New Publications, followed by a constant succession of
Standard Works in every department of Ancient and Modern Literature, selected with
care and judgment, but it likewise presents a medium for Literary Inquirers to prosecute
their researches and interchange their opinions. Nor is this correspondence confined to
our own land. From the Colonies and America, over which it ranges in its wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
circulation, we continue to receive gratifying testimonials to its usefulness, as well as
accessions to its columns, and have reason to believe it is duly appreciated by those whose
favour it is our study to deserve and interest to secure.</p>

<p>The aim of the publisher has been to establish a literary organ of communication
amongst his numerous Subscribers and Friends, by inviting their correspondence, and
throwing open his columns to their inquiries and suggestions, and thus by propounding
queries, solving difficulties, and eliciting new facts, rendering some slight service to the
cause of Historical and Literary Truth. So cordially have they responded to this invitation,
that the task of selection has been sometimes a difficult, though always a pleasing one.
If there have been any communications from Correspondents which have not met with due
regard and consideration, it must be pleaded in apology that this miscellany of curious information
necessarily embraces so wide a field, that in gathering in the harvest it is not
surprising if a few ears of corn escape the gleaner's hand. If it be said that occasionally
too much notice has been taken of "unconsidered trifles," and that the objects regarded
were too minute and insignificant to justify the patient attention bestowed upon them;
the saying of Dr. Johnson may be adopted as a justification, that "the man who
removes the smallest obstacle in the pathway of Literature becomes its benefactor."
History is built up of fragments as the pyramid is formed of single stones; and
if we have only laid bare one doubtful point, or elucidated one novel fact,&mdash;if we
have but stripped off the moss clinging to some ruined archway of the past, or
decyphered one mouldering inscription,&mdash;then our work has been accomplished, and our
toil repaid.</p>

<p>The publisher wishes it to be distinctly understood that he is not the author of any
representations or opinions which may appear in the <i>Current Notes</i>. Every statement,
therefore, is open to correction or discussion, and the writers of the several paragraphs
must be considered alone responsible for their assertions. Holding himself aloof from
the bias of all personal interest or party feeling, the publisher can make due allowance
for difference of opinion, and like heralds in the tournament, after proclaiming the titles
of the respective champions, quietly retires and awaits the issue of the fray. If in the heat
of this literary joust of arms, the combatants have broken spears somewhat too hotly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
let it be remembered that he is only a spectator of the chivalrous feud&mdash;which, after all,
has for its sole object the rescue of Truth, in the words of the old knightly motto, "sans
tache et sans reproche."</p>

<p>It is a mournful task to record the death of the gifted&mdash;to follow Genius to its
grave. Our Obituary of the past year chronicles the death of many who were giants in
the realms of thought, and whom the world of science and learning could ill afford to
lose. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, of whom (as was said of CÃ¦sar) it is difficult to decide whether he
fought or wrote with the greater spirit; Eliot <span class="smcap">Warburton</span>, the Historian and Novelist;
<span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>, the Naturalist; <span class="smcap">Scrope</span>, the Deerstalker; <span class="smcap">Johannot</span>, the Artist; the
gay and accomplished <span class="smcap">Count D'Orsay</span>; <span class="smcap">Landseer</span>, the Engraver; <span class="smcap">Mantell</span>, the
Geologist&mdash;are now numbered with the dead. <span class="smcap">Pugin</span>, too, has passed away&mdash;he, whose
whole life was but one continued aspiration after the Beautiful in Christian Art; the
harp of <span class="smcap">Moore</span> is silent, and awakens no echoes in the tomb.</p>

<p>Upon one occurrence of the past year, however, the publisher has particularly to
congratulate his Subscribers; namely the Free Trade movement which has broken up the
monopoly of the Booksellers' Association, increased the sale of books, and imparted new
vigour and activity to the cause of literature. Cheapness in the price of books becomes
an important auxiliary in the diffusion of knowledge. It is not merely a trade, but a social
question, on account of the power it possesses of advancing intellectual improvement.
The thirst for knowledge must be considerably influenced by the means we have at hand
to supply and satisfy its craving. Long before Lord Campbell pronounced his judgment,
the publisher was impressed with the truth of these views, and had steadily adhered to
them as the basis of his business. The recent Postal Regulations have also tended to facilitate
the purchase of books. By their means he has been enabled not only to forward
the <i>Price Current</i> to his Subscribers at a trifling cost, but to execute and transmit orders
from a thin pamphlet to a ponderous volume. Facilities of a like nature now exist for
sending books to the Colonies; and instead of being obliged to forward as heretofore,
even the smallest book as a package at a high charge for conveyance, any moderate-sized
volume, if left open at the ends, will reach its destination in the letter-bags, at a very
trifling cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The publisher thinks it not inappropriate to reprint in this place the following
<span class="smcap">Notice to Correspondents</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> begs to express his acknowledgments for the numerous interesting communications which have been
forwarded to him, and will feel obliged by the receipt of any original articles on subjects, either of a literary or an
antiquarian nature. Woodcuts, illustrative of subjects requiring them, will be executed at his expense.</p>

<p>All communications intended for insertion in the "<i>Current Notes</i>" must be accompanied by the Writer's real
name and address, which are merely required as a guarantee of his good faith, and not for publication, except at his
desire.</p></blockquote>

<p>While cordially reiterating the sentiments expressed in the first of the preceding
paragraphs, the publisher can assure his Subscribers that the work, intended as a boon
to themselves, has proved an equal source of gratification to him; and so, with mutual
good wishes, trusts they may long continue, in the words of Milton, "with plain and
lightsome brevity to relate well and orderly things worth the noting."</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">To the "Price Current of Literature."</span></div>


<p><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> gratefully acknowledges the various interesting
documents and letters he has received. He is anxious
that it should be perfectly understood that he is not the
author of any statement, representation, or opinion, that
may appear in his "Current Notes," which are merely selections
from communications made to him in the course of
his business, and which appear to him to merit attention.
Every statement therefore is open to correction or discussion,
and the writers of the several paragraphs should be
considered as alone responsible for their assertions. Although
many notes have hitherto appeared anonymously,
or with initial letters, yet wherever a serious contradiction
is involved, G. Willis trusts that his Correspondents will
feel the necessity of allowing him to make use of their
names when properly required.</p>

<p>Do not you think a very interesting work
might be written, to be entitled an Historical Account
of the celebrated Villas in the neighbourhood of London.
I mean rather the Villas that have been&mdash;than those

<p>Look at Horace Walpole's Song on Strawberry Hill.
How many places are there mentioned which have historical

would be worth preserving.</p>

<p>There must be always great interest about the localities

<p>Perhaps I overrate the interest with which such a
book would be read. I certainly do not, if it would
equal that, with which I myself read the account of
places in the neighbourhood of Paris, remarkable in
history, but the traces of which&mdash;many of which at

appears from the
public Prints
that the late
eminent artist,
J. M. W. Turner,
never sat for
his Portrait;&mdash;and
the only
likenesses of
him were taken
by stealth,
I send you
a rude sketch
which I took of
him in the same
way, about the
year 1805 or 6.
He was then on
a visit at Mr.
Fawkes's, of
Farnley, where
a number of
grouse shooters
had assembled,&mdash;and
Turner
had adopted the
garb of a sportsman.
His appearance,
as well as his exploits on the moors, were the
subject of much mirth.</p>

<p>One day we accompanied him on an excursion, for
the purpose of taking a sketch of the magnificent scenery
of Gordale, in Craven, from which he afterwards produced
a finished painting.</p>

<p>My rude sketch of his person was considered a
characteristic resemblance at the time; and though it
has the air of a caricature, yet was not meant as such
when it was drawn.</p>

<p>If you think it would interest the readers of your
"Current Notes," you will perhaps give it as an illustration.
If not, I will thank you to return it to me.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Monumental Brasses Removed from the Churches
of Fulham and Chelsea.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Geo. Willis</span>,&mdash;Your Correspondent, under the
head of "Antiquarian Sacrilege," (<i>Current Notes for
December, p. 91,</i>) seems not to be aware that almost
all Church Brasses, with very few exceptions, were torn
from their places by the sectarian soldiers in Cromwell's
time, who affected to consider such things idolatrous.
They were for the most part sold for old brass, and
some authority (I forget who at this moment), tells us
that, in consequence of the number at one time brought
into the market, the price of brass was decreased in
proportion. There were very few Antiquaries in those
days, consequently a very small number of these desecrated
Brasses have been preserved, and for those we
possess we are indebted to such men as Ashmole, Lilly,
and others of that class, who, though sufficiently fantastic
and visionary in their pursuits, were still men of
some learning and taste.</p>

<p>Some, if not the whole of the lots alluded to by your
Correspondent, came into the possession of the late John
Meyrick, Esq., through an ancestor of his wife, whose
name was "Rush," and the only sacrilege committed by
the late Mr. Meyrick seems to have been the preservation
of these things from destruction.</p>

<p>I have frequently heard the late Sir S. R. Meyrick
mention these Brasses, and regret they were not in his
possession.</p>

<p>I was rejoiced at the first glance at F. C. B.'s communication
(p. 88 "Current Notes" for November),
but doubts very soon arose, whether some oversight had
not occurred in taking the portrait of <i>Robert</i> Bertie,
for that enquired after, which is <i>Montague</i> Bertie.
On turning to Granger I found this to be the case, for
the portrait which F. C. B. has, is there given as <i>Robert</i>,
so that I fear the right one remains yet <i>non est inventus</i>,
for I do not consider "A Dealer," as speaking
from any distinct recollection of such a portrait, which
must be an 8vo. one, whereas Faithorne's is in 4to.</p>

as it is from the late Mr. Hood's daughter, who is married
to the Rev. S. Broderip, Rector of Cossington,

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;For the information of your two correspondents,
"A Subscriber," and "R. O. W." ("Current
Notes" for December, p. 95), I beg to repeat my assertion
that there was an edition of "The Holy Court,"
by N. Caussin, published in <i>Corke</i>. In fact, (if I mistake
not), there were two editions, one in 1765, without
plates; and one in 1767, with very excellent plates. I
can procure an imperfect copy of the former for either
of your correspondents for one shilling; and a fine copy
of the latter for thirty to thirty-five shillings, full calf,
with plates.</p>

<p>The work was printed in Broad-lane&mdash;(perhaps so
called quasi "lucus a non lucendo," as the lane is certainly
rather narrow)&mdash;and was very well got up. The
date and place of printing are thus given in the first
edition: Corke: "Printed anno Domini 1765."</p>

The tomb is a much more highly ornate specimen of an
ancient cross than any of those engraved in Dr. Petrie's
work on the Round Towers of Ireland. At Tullilease
there are the ruins of an old Romanesque church, which
was dedicated to St. Berichert or Berihert, a Saxon,
whose name is now Anglicised into Benjamin, and whose
death is recorded at <small>A.D.</small> 839, in the Four Masters.
The Legend on the stone is in Latin, (but very sorry
Latin), and in the Irish character. It reads, "QUICUNQUE

<div class='right'>
January 10th, 1852.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;All our historians assert that Richard, Duke of
Glo'ster paved his way to the crown by bastardizing,
imprisoning, and assassinating his two nephews, Edward
Prince of Wales and Richard Duke of York. How
then are we to account for the provision made in the
Wardrobe Roll for the Coronation of Richard III.,
July 3rd, 1483, (published in the Antiquarian Repertory,
Vol. I. p. 29, 1807;) "<i>The deliveree of divers
Stuff delivered for the use of Lorde Edwarde, son of
late Kyng Edward the Fourthe, and of his Henxemen?</i>"
Then follows a particular account of the materials
for the "<i>apparaill and array</i>" of "<i>Prince
Edward</i>" and his "<i>Henxemen</i>." Was he really
present at his uncle's coronation? There is no mention
of the Duke of York. The Declaration of Tyrrell
and Dighton, published in the ensuing reign by
Henry VII., says, the young princes were murdered in
July, 1483. If the words did not expressly state "<i>Edwarde,
son of late Kyng Edwarde the Fourthe</i>," I
should have concluded that it meant Richard III.'s
own son Edward, by Lady Ann Nivelle, at that time
about nine years of age.</p>

<p>This testimonial is in the shape of a magnificent
Rosewood Library Chair, richly carved, and covered
with the finest French Satin Brocade. It is at this
moment <i>on</i> the Atlantic, <i>in</i> the "Atlantic," and insured
by the Atlantic Insurance Company, for three hundred

<p>As <span class="smcap">the fame of Shakspere</span> is world-wide, subscriptions
of five dollars each came in from all parts of

Maine,&mdash;to Mexico. From Wisconsin, in the <i>far</i>-far-<small>FAR</small>
West, to the shores of the Pacific, at San Francisco&mdash;they
are thousands of miles apart from each other.</p>

<p>Why have you left it to us poor Yankees "to take
the wind out of your sails," in presenting a testimonial
to the authoress of the Concordance to Shakspere?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Mr. Payne Collier, and such like dear fellows, who
know so many eminent wealthy literati, ought, <i>now</i> that
we have set you the example, to get up a subscription, and
present Mrs. Clarke with some better Shaksperean testimonial
than a Chair! What say you to a '<span class="smcap">First</span>' Best
Bed? But if the hangings of it beat our satin brocade
cover, why I'll hang myself in despair&mdash;no I won't, but
I'll eat it&mdash;bed&mdash;feathers and all. The Chair was to
have been covered with the richest silk Genoa velvet, of
a regal scarlet or crimson, but the lady of our Secretary
of State, Mrs. Daniel Webster, would have it, that
velvet covers were quite old-fashioned; and as ladies
best know what will suit ladies, she was asked the favour
to select the cover, and <i>I guess</i> you will admire it.</p>

<p>Now for the <i>freedom</i> of America. Collins gave the
Chair <i>free</i> passage. Edwards, Sandford and Co. conveyed
the case to the ship, and will convey it from
Liverpool to London, <i>free</i>. They are Express men, and
thus do we "go a-head."</p>

<p>"I receive your 'Notes' regularly. The story about

embellished by '<i>your New York Special Reporter</i>.'
I regret to tell you that she, poor girl, has
quite <i>put her foot in it</i> here, and I am afraid will
return poorer than when she came. She or her agent
or agents, pursued a silly course by, <i>it is said</i>, keeping
almost open house to her countrymen at the Astor house,
a very expensive hotel, where she ran up an enormous
bill, and being unable to pay, the sheriff's officers carried
off the receipts at some of her concerts&mdash;particularly that
which she gave for that humbug hypocrite Father
Mathew. There has been a great deal about it in our
papers. Doctor Joy returned to England some time ago
in disgust. Mathew absolutely had the temerity to
make it appear that he could work miracles, <i>publicly</i>,
in the face of a large Catholic congregation, by restoring
the sick and lame to health!"</p>

the city of Eximaya, in Central America, by an Englishman
and two Spaniards, who are all 'gone dead.'"
Observing that, "It is a good Arabian Night's hoax.
You will see," he remarks, "the pamphlet is dated
1850, but the children have only been exhibited here
this week. There is <i>no mistake</i> about them, they are
evidently children of a distinct and unknown race, come
from whence they will. The recession of their foreheads
is extraordinary. Their heads are wonderfully small,
and in exact proportion to their bodies and limbs. They
are not dwarfs but pigmies; about twelve years of age,
lively and playful. They are not at Barnum's Museum,

century; which may be found attached to the iron
frame of casement windows in many old farm houses.</p>

<p>A latch is not a turnbuckle, and no ironmonger's
apprentice would confound the two. A latch is a bar
moving up and down in a limited space&mdash;or, if backwards
and forwards, as in some locks&mdash;it is called the
latch-bolt. A turnbuckle, as its name implies, turns
round, and is only limited by the notch, &amp;c. by which it
holds. They are chiefly of two kinds: one is a spindle,
with a knob or ring at one end, and a tongue or buckle
at the other; another is a handle with a tongue attached,
moving together freely round, upon a pin or
rivets. This latter kind has taken the place of the
casement latch represented in your "Current Notes"
in present use.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Rowland Hill and the Penny Postage.</span></h2>


<p>The following is the commencement of a leading
article on the Penny Postage, contained in the "<i>Times</i>,"
of Saturday, 9th August, 1851:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A traveller sauntering through the Lake districts of
England some years ago, arrived at a small public-house
just as the postman stopped to deliver a letter. A young
girl came out to receive it. She took it in her hand,
turned it over and over, and asked the charge. It was a
large sum&mdash;no less than a shilling. Sighing heavily, she
observed that it came from her brother, but that she was
too poor to take it in, and she returned it to the postman
accordingly. The traveller was a man of kindness as well
as of observation; he offered to pay the postage himself,
and in spite of more reluctance on the girl's part than he
could well understand, he did pay it, and gave her the
letter. No sooner, however, was the postman's back
turned, than she confessed that the proceeding had been
concerted between her brother and herself, that the letter
was empty, that certain signs on the direction conveyed all
she wanted to know, and that as they could neither of
them afford to pay postage, they had devised this method
of franking the intelligence desired. The traveller pursued
his journey, and as he plodded over the Cumberland
fells, he mused upon the badness of a system which drove
people to such straits for means of correspondence, and
defeated its own object all the time. With most men such
musings would have ended before the close of the hour,
but this man's name was <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>, and it was from
this incident and these reflections that the whole scheme of
Penny Postage was derived."</p></blockquote>

<p>I should be glad to know if there is any doubt as to
the truth of this statement, as I fancied it had been
contradicted. Could any of your Correspondents oblige
me by giving me information on the subject, I should
feel obliged.</p>

chiefly in Mississippi, although in some instances extending
to Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, he found
that Dentistry had been extensively practised by this

<p><span class="smcap">Capping a Story.</span>&mdash;Rogers, the poet, was fond of
telling the story of a gentleman who lost a shilling in
Covent Garden Market, just at the corner of the Great
Piazza, and on his return from India some five-and-twenty
years afterwards, on passing the spot where he
supposed the loss had taken place, remembered the circumstance,
and looking about him on the pavement,
picked up his shilling. Here Rogers, in his own inimitable
way of telling a story, would pause, and then add&mdash;"<span class="smcap">In
halfpence</span>, <i>wrapped up in paper</i>."</p>

<p>"I knew the man," said a witty friend to the poet,
"but you have forgotten the most singular point of the
story about the recovery of this lost shilling <i>just at the
door of Willis the bookseller's place of business</i>."</p>

<p>"I thought it sufficiently odd," replied the poetical
banker, "our friend having found his shilling after so
long a period, and only wish that my lost notes may turn
up again in the same unexpected and amusing manner&mdash;<i>that
notes turn up to me from Willis</i>."</p>

<p>"Then you must have heard the whole story, and the
very remarkable fact to which I refer? That in the
paper which contained the four-and-twenty halfpence he
found another filled with farthings, the exact amount of
which when calculated, proved to be that of compound
interest upon the shilling for five-and-twenty years one
month and thirteen days."</p>

<p>D. E., 47, <i>Blessington Street, Dublin,</i> thanked for
his suggestions. The R. I. A.&mdash;T. C. D. and the Dublin
Society, however, cannot in the slightest degree influence
the conduct of G. W.'s "Current Notes."</p>

<p>If these learned bodies regard their own situation,
they will not object to "any slang, coarseness, or Americanisms."
They should rather reflect how much
America has and <i>probably</i> will teach young Ireland&mdash;<small>BUT
NOT</small> <i>through</i> their agency, as publishers.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Admission of Literary Inquirers to the Public
Records.</span></h2>


<p>Regulations under which permission will be given
to Literary Inquirers to make searches among the Public
Records, without payment of fees, contained in a letter
addressed by the Right Honourable Sir John Romilly,
Master of the Rolls to Sir Francis Palgrave, K.H., the
Deputy Keeper of the Public Records: dated at the
Rolls House, 4th December, 1851:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the individuals seeking to avail themselves
of the permission shall address a letter to the Deputy
Keeper, stating generally their objects of research, so as
to show that the applications are really and <i>bonÃ¢ fide</i> for
literary purposes, and that the applicant shall also
attend the Deputy Keeper personally thereon, and give
such further explanation as may be required; and that
thereupon the Deputy Keeper shall, if he be satisfied
with the statement and explanation, authorise the Assistant
Keepers to allow the applicant to inspect such
Indexes of Records, and also such Original Records, and
to make such copies or extracts in pencil required by the
applicant as the Deputy Keeper may think advisable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This mode of proceeding, which is equally required for
the security of the Records, and for the protection of
the business searchers, will in fact be beneficial to
Literary Inquirers; for the more fully they explain their
objects, the better will the Deputy Keeper and the
other officers be able to direct them to the documents
which may be useful to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>2ndly. That all the applications before mentioned be
entered in a book, and be reported to the Master of the
Rolls.</p>

<p>3rdly. That a book be kept at each branch office, in
which the Assistant Keeper shall enter a note or particular
of the Rolls, Records, Books, or Documents, called
for, inspected, or used by the applicant, nearly in the
same manner, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as is practised with
respect to Manuscripts in the British Museum.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But this book is to be considered as confidential, and not
to be shown to the public without express permission
of the Master of the Rolls or Deputy Keeper.</p></blockquote>

<p>4thly. That, in case of any impropriety or abuse of the
privilege, the Assistant Keepers do forthwith report the
same to the Deputy Keeper, in order that he may bring
the same before the Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>It will be necessary also to explain to the Literary
Inquirers that the time of the various officers and other
persons employed in the Public Record Office is so wholly
engrossed by the performance of their present duties,
that it will not be possible for the officers to assist any
Literary Inquirers beyond the production of the documents,
and giving a general explanation, if needed, of
their character and nature. No applicant ought to present
himself who is not sufficiently acquainted with the
hand-writing, abbreviations, and language of ancient
documents, so as to be able to read and decipher their
contents.</p>

<p>The Literary Inquirer will have free access to the
documents, but, this being done, he will have to conduct
the inquiry from these documents in such manner as his
own knowledge and capacity may best enable him to do.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p><i>G. W. is informed that the reading Public are indebted
to John Bruce, Esq., the Treasurer of the
Society of Antiquaries, for this important concession
on the part of the Master of the Rolls; and it has
been suggested that a suitable testimonial should be
presented to Mr. Bruce by those historical inquirers
who are likely to derive such valuable aid from his
exertions.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Literary Auctions.</span>&mdash;That there is no lack of enthusiasm
among amateurs for the possession of rare
and curious works, is evidenced by the prices which
some books of this class brought at a sale just concluded
by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson, being the
first sale of importance this season. Among them may
be noticed the following:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orloge</span> (l') <span class="smcap">de Sapience</span>, folio, <i>nouvellement imprimÃ©e
Ã  Paris</i>, 1493. <span class="smcap">A very splendid specimen
of printing on vellum</span>, <i>from the celebrated Press
of</i> <span class="smcap">Verard</span>, <i>ruled with red lines, bound in red morocco
extra, gilt edges, by Bauzonnet, with a well made pigskin
case to contain it</i>.</p>

<p>Of this singular Ascetical Romance, M. Van Praet states
that six copies are known as being printed on vellum: of
these three are in the National Library at Paris, all of which
are more or less adorned with miniatures, two of them,
like the present, having the summary of the chapters (left
blank for the insertion of the miniatures) written in a
contemporary hand on the margins. The Harleian copy,
afterwards in the collections of Count Macarthy and Mr.
Hibbert, was adorned with thirteen miniatures: the present
beautiful volume has <small>SIXTEEN</small>, the additional ones
being at the commencement of the chapters, in which the
same subjects are treated in a different manner. <span class="smcap">The</span>
whole of the fine miniatures are in the best style of French
art. <span class="smcap">This lot sold for</span> Â£45.</p>
